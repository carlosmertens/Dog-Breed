# Project: Dog Breed App
## Content: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

### Description

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! In this project, we will demostrate how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, our algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, we will make important design decisions about the user experience for the app.  Our goal is that by completing this lab, we can demostrate the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.  Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.  Our imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!

### Install

Follow instructions to create enviroment:

```
requirements/installation.txt
```
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### Code

Template code was provided by Udacity in the `dog_app.ipynb` notebook file. It is also required to use the included `extract_bottleneck_features.py` Python file to run the app. While some code was already implemented to get me started, I needed to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Dog-Breed` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook dog_app.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
